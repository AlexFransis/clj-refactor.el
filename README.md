# clj-refactor.el

`clj-refactor` provides refactoring support for clojure projects.

## Installation

I highly recommend installing clj-refactor through elpa.

It's available on [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and
[melpa](http://melpa.org/):

    M-x package-install clj-refactor

## Setup

```el
(require 'clj-refactor)
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook (lambda ()
                               (clj-refactor-mode 1)
                               ;; insert keybinding setup here
                               ))
```

You'll also have to set up the keybindings in the lambda. Read on.

### Setup keybindings

All functions in clj-refactor have a two-letter mnemonic shortcut. For
instance, rename-file-or-dir is `rf`. You get to choose how those are bound.
Here's how:

```el
(cljr-add-keybindings-with-prefix "C-c C-m")
;; eg. rename files with `C-c C-m rf`.
```

If you would rather have a modifier key, instead of a prefix, do:

```el
(cljr-add-keybindings-with-modifier "C-s-")
;; eg. rename files with `C-s-r C-s-f`.
```

If neither of these appeal to your sense of keyboard layout aesthetics, feel free
to pick and choose your own keybindings with a smattering of:

```el
(define-key clj-refactor-map (kbd "C-x C-r") 'cljr-rename-file-or-dir)
```

**The keybindings suggested here might be conflicting with keybindings in
either clojure-mode or cider. Ideally, you should pick keybindings that don't
interfere with either.**

### Optional setup

#### Refactor nREPL middleware

For some of the more advanced refactorings we've written an [nrepl](https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl) middleware called
[refactor-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl).

Add the following, either in your project's `project.clj` or in the `:user`
profile found at `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

```clojure
:plugins [[refactor-nrepl "1.0.5"]]
```

**WARNING** The analyzer needs to eval the code too in order to be able to build
  the AST we can work with. If that causes side effects like writing files,
  opening connections to servers, modifying databases, etc. performing certain
  refactoring functions on your code will do that, too.

#### Yasnippet
If you're not using yasnippet, then the "jumping back"-part of adding to
namespace won't work. To remedy that, enable the mode with either:

```el
(yas/global-mode 1)
```

or

```el
(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook (lambda () (yas/minor-mode 1)))
```

It is an excellent package, so I recommend looking into it.

## Usage

See the wiki for a complete [list of available refactorings] (https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki), demonstrations and customization points.

## Changelog

An extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).

## Contribute

Yes, please do. There's a suite of tests, so remember to add tests for your
specific feature, or I might break it later.

You'll find the repo at:

    https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el

To fetch the test dependencies, install
[cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) if you haven't already,
then:

    $ cd /path/to/clj-refactor
    $ cask

Run the tests with:

    $ ./run-tests.sh


Before submitting a patch or a pull request make sure all tests are
passing and that your patch is in line with the [contribution
